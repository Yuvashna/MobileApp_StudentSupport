# MobileApp_StudentSupport 
This android-based app focuses on helping students (especially those within residence) to buy, sell and donate items to/from other students.

My mobile application was developed using Android Studio and Java as its primary programming language. Storage of data is being done by the use of Google Firebase.
Images of the products are uploaded to Google Firebase Storage and displayed when the items are being shown and later an enlargened picture is shown when the item is clicked.
The Google API(specifically the Gmail API) also is used within the app as the first form of communication between the buyer and seller.

This application is able to be bundled as an apk.
